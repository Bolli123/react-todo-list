# Part A: Todo web app
The code to the app in included in this repository, all the base requirements were implemented along with some extra ones

# Part B: Todo web app
The project went great, I tried my hand at TailwindCSS for the first time and it was for sure an interesting experience I used a couple of libraries to make handling dates easier, the calendar library was surprisingly easy to use and style. The code needs to be a little bit more modular to implement some of the things I want, like adding multiple lists properly without too much code duplication. 

UX could be improved a bit, I could spend weeks tinkering with the CSS and adding animations to make the experiance better. Better categorization for the tasks would also be great, as in the tasks would be grouped "Today", "Tomorrow", "This Week" etc.

Publishing the app wouldn't take too much effort, dockerize it and plonk it on a server, but scaling it would require a lot of modification, like adding user login and accounts, not rely on localStorage because it's not concurrent and let's face it, not even a little bit secure eighter.
